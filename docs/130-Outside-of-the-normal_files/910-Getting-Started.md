# Getting started in your classroom

To start incorporating the Compact approach to your class, you might:

1. Start the course in the usual way. 
    a. Move through the topics  you like up through the confidence interval on a mean and proportion.
    b. DON'T do hypothesis testing yet. 
    c. Additional topic: Try to introduce the variance along with the standard deviation. There's a nice explanation in Chapter 3 that you might find helpful.
    d. Additional topic: Demonstrate that calculating a  proportion is the same as calculating the mean of an indicator variable.

2. Use models rather than "two sample" or "differences."
    a. Present actual data in a response variable vs explanatory variable format. 
    b. Use the Point Plot Little App to make graphics with both categorical and quantitative response and explanatory variables.
    c. Project such  plots on the board or print them on paper. Have students practice drawing models. Don't worry about exact calculations yet. If you want exact, you can use the Proportions and Point Plot Little Apps.

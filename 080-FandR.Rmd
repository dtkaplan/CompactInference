# F and R


`r  if(knitr::is_html_output()) "$\\newcommand{\\flex}[]{^\\circ\\!{\\cal{F}}}$"`

We now have the pieces we need to assemble the central quantity which informs statistical inference. These are:

1. $n$, the sample size (or, more concretely, the number of rows in out data frame)
2. $v_r$, the variance of the response variable. $v_r$ for binary categorical response variables is based on the 0-1 encoding.
3. $v_m$, the variance of the model values.
4. $\flex$, the *degree of flexibility*.^[If  you are reading  this book in conjunction with a conventional text, remember  that such texts frame inference in terms of the *degrees of **freedom**,* df. The relationship is $\mbox{df} \equiv n -  (\flex +  1)$.]

We'll put these together to form a quantity called F.

## The F statistic

The name, F, is in honor of Ronald Fisher, one of the leading statisticians of the first half of the 20th. The formula for F is pretty simple, so I'll present it right here for ready reference.  

$$F \equiv \frac{n - (1 + \flex)}{\flex} \frac{v_m}{v_r - v_m}$$
For almost all the settings considered in introductory statistics courses, $\flex$ is 1, so the formula simplifies to:
$$F =  (n-1) \frac{v_m}{v_r - v_m}$$
Example: Figure 4.1 shows a model of child's height with respect to sex.  The variance of the response variable (child's height) is $v_r = $12.84 inches^2^. The variance of the model values is $v_m =$ 6.55 inches^2^. The data used to construct the model have $n = 898$  Thus:

$$F = 897 \frac{6.55}{12.84-6.55} \approx 897 \times 1.04 \approx 934 .$$

## What's the meaning of F?

F combines the four quantities $n$, $v_r$, $v_m$, and $\flex$. To get a notion why the combination  works, keep these basic ideas in mind concerning what it means to have "more evidence."

- The larger $n$, the more evidence. That's why F is more-or-less proportional to $n$.  (Strictly speaking,  F is proportional to $n - (\flex +  1)$.)
- The more complicated the model -- e.g. the number of explanatory variables or levels in an explanatory categorical variable -- the less evidence. Or, put another way, we would want  more evidence from data to justify a complicated model than  a simple model. The division  by $\flex$ in the formula for F implements this idea.
- The closer the model values come to capturing the actual response variable, the greater the evidence that there is a relationship. An obvious 
way to quantify this closeness are with the difference $v_r - v_m$. We want the size of F to increase as  $v_m$  gets  closer  to  $v_r$. So F is proportional to  $\frac{1}{v_r - v_m}$.
- But the numerical value of the difference $v_r - v_m$ depends on the units in which the response variable  is measured.  For  instance, we could express the running  times in Chapter 1 in minutes or in seconds. But the difference $v_r - v_m$ would be $60^2 = 3600$ times larger if we  used seconds than minutes. Obviously we don't want our F value to depend on the units used. To avoid that, we divide $v_r - v_m$ by $v_m$, getting the $v_m / (v_r - v_m)$ in the formula for F.


## R-squared

Many people prefer to look at a ratio $v_m  / v_r$ to quantify how close the model values are to  the values of the response variable. If the model does a good job accounting for the response variable, then $v_m$ will be close to $v_r$. That is, the ratio will  be close to 1. On the other hand, if the model tells us little or nothing about  the response variable, $v_m$ will  be close to zero and the ratio itself  will be zero.

The ratio has a famous name: *R-squared*,  that  is:

$$R^2 = v_m / v_r$$
A more  obscure name for $R^2$ is *coefficient of determination*, which is awkward but  does express the point  that $R^2$ is about  the extent to  which the explanatory variables, when  passed  through the model, determine the response variable. $R^2$ is, literally, the faction of  the variance of the response variable that has been captured by the model. 

$R^2$ can never be bigger than one and can never be negative. When $R^2 = 1$,  the model  values are  exactly the same as the values of  the response variable. 

When there is no connection between the r esponse and explanatory variables, $R^2$ will be  small. Ideally, it  would be zero, but the process of random sampling generally pushes it a little away from zero. One way to think about F is as indicating  when there is so little  data that a small but non-zero R^2^ is consistent with the hypothesis that there is no connection between the response and explanatory variables.

Example: Figure 4.1 shows a model of child's height with respect to sex. The variance of the response variable (child's height) is 12.84 inches^2^. The variance of the model values is 6.55 inches^2^. Thus:
$$R^2 = 6.55 /  12.84 = 0.51 = 51\%$$

## F in statistics books

In most statistics book, F is not written in the form above but in one of a couple of alternative -- but  equivalent  -- forms. There's no particular reason to use these forms. Knowing what they look like  will help  you  make sense of traditional statistical reports.

Since $R^2$  summarizes the relationship  between $v_m$ and $v_r$, the formula for F can be written in terms of $R^2$. This is the first of the alternative forms.

$$F = \frac{n - (\flex+1)}{\flex} \frac{R^2}{1 - R^2}$$

Another alternative form comes from using an intermediate in the  calculation  of $v_m$ and $v_r$. Recall how the variance is calculated by calculating square differences and averaging. To average, of course, you  add together the quantities and  then  divide  by the  number of quantities  being averaged.

Suppose you didn't bother  to average, and stopped after adding up the square differences. The name for this intermediate is the  *sum of squares*.
F is often written in terms of the sum of squares of the response variable SS_r_ and of the model values SS_m_. Something like this:

$$F = \frac{n - (\flex+1)}{\flex} \frac{\mbox{SS}_m}{\mbox{SS}_r - \mbox{SS}_m}$$

More typically, instead instead  of  looking at the model  values directly,  the tradition  in  classical inference is to consider what's called the  *sum of squares of the residuals*, which is simply SSR = $\mbox{SS}_r - \mbox{SS}_m$ and the  formula is re-written like this:

$$F = \frac{\mbox{SS}_m / \flex}{SSR / (n -  (\flex + 1))}.$$
Both the numerator and the denominator of this ratio have the form of a sum  of squares divided by a count. In the terminology of classical inference, such things are called *mean squares*. 

In this book, we'll just use the formula for F given at the start of this chapter. The others give exactly the same value, but let's avoid  having  ton work with potentially confusing  vocabulary such  as the  mean square and sum  of squares.

## Another explanation of F

First, I'll give the explanation in the form of a parable. Imagine that your model is a automobile. You are going to drive it a distance of 100 miles. There are two gas companies, EXPLANATORY Fuel and RANDOM Fuel. You put in 2 liters of EXPLANATORY gas and drive as far as you can get, say 44 miles. Your fuel economy on the EXPLANATORY part of the trip  is  thus 22 miles per liter. You're out of fuel, but conveniently there is a RANDOM gas station close at hand. You fill up your  tank with  RANDOM gas and continue driving. You drive the rest of the way  using the random gas. Looking at the fuel  gauge, you  see that you have used up 8 liters of RANDOM gas,  the fuel economy is  56 miles (that is, 100-44) per  8 liters of RANDOM gas, so the fuel economy is only 7 miles per gallon of RANDOM gas.

Now a skeptic asks you, "The EXPLANATORY gas company has a good name for marketing, but do you have any good reason to think that EXPLANATORY gas is better than RANDOM gas?" Of course, the answer is yes, but  how to summarize your findings? One way is to compare the  fuel economies of the different kinds of gas: 22 miles per gallon for EXPLANATORY and 7 for  RANDOM. More concisely, you could say that EXPLANATORY gas is more than 3 times (22/7) as efficient as RANDOM gas. 

The miles travelled using EXPLANATORY gas corresponds to R^2^. The fuel itself is whatever explanatory variables (and nonlinearities and whatever) are in your model. The amount of EXPLANATORY gas is $\flex$. 

RANDOM gas is not manufactured from genuine explanatory variables. Instead it is synthesized purely from random numbers. You don't expect RANDOM gas to be very good. But it serves as a point of comparison for the effectiveness of EXPLANATORY gas.

To conduct the comparison, you'll look at the ratio of the fuel economies: EXPLANATORY  fuel economy divided  by RANDOM fuel economy. That ratio of fuel economies corresponds exactly to F.

Perhaps you're thinking, "RANDOM gas won't get you anywhere." That's not true. You can confirm this by creating a dataset that consists only of random numbers then modeling one of the variables by the others. You'll find that R^2^ is not zero. Indeed, if you use $n-1$ random explanatory variables in your model, you're guaranteed to reach $\mbox{R}^2 = 1$.

Figure 6.13 shows simulations of R^2^ versus $\flex$ for RANDOM gas. (Not every gallon of RANDOM gas is the same, it's random!)

(ref:R-path-cap) Figure 6.13: The dark path shows one trial in which the car is fueled entirely with 
RANDOM gas. The graph shows how far the car gets (in terms of R^2^) as it uses more and more fuel (in terms of $\flex$).

```{r R-path, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:R-path-cap)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/14-R2-vs-m.png")
```

Figure 6.14 shows schematically the general form of distance R^2^ versus fuel consumption when the first 10 units of fuel (that is to say, $\flex = 10$) are EXPLANATORY gas. As you can see, the EXPLANATORY gas got you  to R^2^ = 65%. So the fuel economy for EXPLANATORY gas is about 6.5% per unit of fuel.

(ref:R-path2-cap) Figure 6.14: $\mbox{R}^2$ versus $\flex$. For the first 10 units of fuel, EXPLANATORY gas was used. Then the car switched over to RANDOM fuel for the rest of the journey to $\mbox{R}^2 = 1$. Note that the path upward to the blue dot  (using EXPLANATORY gas) is much steeper than for the rest of the journey using RANDOM gas.  The slope of each segment is the fuel economy.

```{r R-path2, echo=FALSE, fig.cap="(ref:R-path2-cap)"}
knitr::include_graphics("images/14-model-walk-example.png")
```

With enough RANDOM gas, you'll get the rest of the way to R^2^ = 100%. How much is enough? $n - (\flex + 1)$ units of fuel. Since $n=50$ and $\flex = 10$, the RANDOM gas fuel economy is 35% (that is, 100% - 65%) divided by 39, or just under 1% per unit of fuel. The F statistic is therefore 6.5% / 1% = 6.5.

Is 6.5 a big enough F to convince us that the EXPLANATORY gas is clearly not just RANDOM gas in disguise? We can find that out by doing a simulation where we use only RANDOM gas in the car, comparing how far we get with the first $\flex = 10$ liters to how much addition RANDOM fuel to get to our eventual destination of R^2^ = 100%. That's what Figure 6.13 is about. You can mark on any of those random paths the value of R^2^ reached with the first $\flex = 10$ liters of fuel. Then draw in the equivalent of the blue slope and the red slope. For the large majority of trials, the ratio of slopes will be less than 4. So $F = 6.5$ is not a plausible outcome when  using only RANDOM fuel in  the car. 

Note the expression for F in terms of R^2^:

$$F \equiv \frac{\mbox{R}^2}{\flex} \div \frac{1 - \mbox{R}^2}{n - (\flex + 1)}$$

The first ratio in the above is the slope of the blue line segment in Figure 6.14. The second ratio in  the above is the slope of the red line segment in Figure  6.14.
